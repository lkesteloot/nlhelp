NLHelp
======

NLHelp is an online help system with a natural language interface. It's a bit like
an FAQ but with a text field to query the answers. It's an experiment for my
mobile app, [OurGroceries](http://ourgroceries.com/), which is why the test
interface has the app's name on it. It's also a way for me to write a non-trivial
program in F#.
